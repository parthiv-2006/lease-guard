## What it does

LeaseGuard reads Ontario residential lease PDFs and produces a clause-by-clause risk report backed by retrieved statute and tribunal text. **The LLM never asserts legal facts from training data alone** — every finding is grounded in real law retrieved from a 2,372-chunk pgvector corpus of the Residential Tenancies Act, O.Reg 516/06, O.Reg 517/06, the Ontario Standard Form of Lease, and 84 real LTB tribunal decisions.

The result: **nine interactive panels** covering risk scoring, red flags, clause exploration, missing protections, negotiation guidance with AI copilot, contradiction detection, statute sources, PDF annotation, and a live Gantt trace of the agent's reasoning — plus a floating AI chat for follow-up questions, all grounded in the same retrieved corpus. The landing page shows a **live public stats bar** (real-time clause count and average risk score across all analyses). Every report has a **one-click share modal** with a generated OG preview card. The **Agent Trace** panel lets you replay the full tool-call sequence as a step-by-step animation, and clicking any RAG bar opens a **drill-down drawer** showing the exact Ontario statute text that was retrieved for that lookup.

## Report panels

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Overview — 9.5 Critical**

Risk gauge, executive summary, and clause breakdown with per-clause risk levels. Four stat cards: Red Flags · Negotiation Points · Missing Protections · Contradictions.

<img src=".github/assets/report-overview.png" alt="Report overview panel" width="100%" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Red Flags**

Every problematic clause with its risk score, violation type, and the exact RTA section it breaches. Grounding confidence badge on each card.

<img src=".github/assets/report-red-flags.png" alt="Red flags panel" width="100%" />

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Clause Explorer**

Full text of every clause annotated with statute citations, enforceability status, benchmark percentiles, and suggested compliant language.

<img src=".github/assets/report-clause-explorer.png" alt="Clause explorer panel" width="100%" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Negotiation Guide**

Prioritised negotiation points with counter-language and action items. One-click **Negotiation Copilot** drafts a tone-aware email or addendum (Assertive / Formal / Cooperative) via Groq Llama 3.3 70B.

<img src=".github/assets/report-negotiation.png" alt="Negotiation panel" width="100%" />

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Missing Protections**

Identifies Ontario RTA protections absent from the lease. Statutory protections still apply by law — their absence from the written lease weakens the tenant's position.

<img src=".github/assets/report-missing-protections.png" alt="Missing protections panel" width="100%" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Contradictions**

Conflicting clauses rendered side-by-side with LLM-detected contradictions (confidence gate ≥ 0.65, regex fallback).

<img src=".github/assets/report-contradictions.png" alt="Contradictions panel" width="100%" />

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Sources**

Every RTA section, regulation, and LTB decision retrieved for this lease — 2,372-chunk corpus with full body text and citation URLs.

<img src=".github/assets/report-sources.png" alt="Sources panel" width="100%" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Agent Trace — Live Gantt + Replay**

Every tool call the agent made, with duration, parallel swim lanes, and input/output summaries. 67 tool calls for a 3-page lease. Switchable Gantt / List view. Hit **▶ Watch the agent work** to animate all tool calls firing in sequence (~15s). Click any amber RAG bar to open a drill-down drawer showing the exact Ontario statute text retrieved for that lookup.

<img src=".github/assets/report-agent-trace.png" alt="Agent trace Gantt with replay" width="100%" />

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**PDF Viewer**

Full pdfjs-dist v5 rendered PDF with persistent clause highlight annotations. Highlights survive page turns and scroll without index drift.

<img src=".github/assets/report-pdf-viewer.png" alt="PDF viewer with highlights" width="100%" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Ask Your Lease — AI Chat**

Floating chat panel powered by Groq Llama 3.3 70B with RAG grounding. Questions are answered with retrieved statute and LTB decision citations — the model never answers from memory alone.

<img src=".github/assets/report-chat.png" alt="Ask Your Lease chat" width="100%" />

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Trace Drill-Down**

Click any amber RAG bar in the Agent Trace Gantt to open a detail drawer. Shows the search query, retrieved statute sections with full body text, citation URLs, and match confidence — the real law the agent used, not a summary.

<img src=".github/assets/report-trace-drilldown.png" alt="Trace drill-down drawer showing retrieved statute" width="100%" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Share Modal + OG Card**

One-click share button on every report opens a modal with a live-generated OpenGraph preview card (1200×630 dark card showing risk score and top clauses) and a copy-link button. Links are valid for 90 days with no personal information exposed.

<img src=".github/assets/report-share-modal.png" alt="Share modal with OG preview card" width="100%" />

**Why grounded retrieval matters:** risk scoring is deterministic TypeScript — no LLM can hallucinate a score. Statute citations come from a pre-validated corpus (7/7 retrieval accuracy), not model memory. Clause enforceability is only flagged when a specific `MANDATORY_PROVISION_VIOLATION` is detected, not just because text sounds unusual.

> **Architecture deep-dive →** [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) covers every major design decision: why MCP over raw function-calling, why pgvector over Pinecone, why Claude as the agent when Gemini is free, and why scoring is deterministic TypeScript instead of a second LLM call.

## Deployment

LeaseGuard is fully deployed across three free-tier services:

| Service | Platform | URL |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Frontend + API routes | [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (free) | [leaseguard-sigma.vercel.app](https://leaseguard-sigma.vercel.app) |
| MCP server (always-on) | [Railway](https://railway.app) (free $5/mo credit) | `leaseguard-mcp-production.up.railway.app` |
| Database + vector store + file storage | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (free) | Managed PostgreSQL + pgvector + Storage |

**Why separate the MCP server?** Vercel serverless functions have a 10-second cold-start limit on the free tier; the MCP server runs a long-lived stdio process and must stay warm. Railway keeps it always-on with a $5/month credit that covers the free tier entirely.

**Uptime monitoring:** Two UptimeRobot monitors ping both health endpoints every 5 minutes to warm Railway before a real upload arrives:
- `GET /api/job/health` (Vercel)
- `GET https://leaseguard-mcp-production.up.railway.app/health` (Railway)

## Features at a glance

### Grounded legal analysis
Every risk flag is backed by a retrieved RTA section or LTB decision — not a guess. The scoring engine is deterministic TypeScript (17 `MANDATORY_PROVISION_VIOLATION` types), so scores are reproducible and explainable.

### Ask Your Lease
A floating chat panel on every report page. Ask natural-language questions ("Is this late fee legal?") and get streaming answers grounded in the same retrieved corpus — statute citations included. Rate-limited at 50 messages/day for authenticated users, 10/day for guests.

### Negotiation Copilot
One click generates a tone-aware email or lease addendum via Groq JSON mode. Choose Assertive, Formal, or Cooperative tone. Export to PDF via jsPDF. Falls back to a template if the LLM is unavailable.

### Live Agent Trace + Replay
See every tool call the agent made, how long it took, and which calls ran in parallel — rendered as a Gantt chart or a flat list. 67 tool calls for a typical 3-page lease. Hit **▶ Watch the agent work** to replay the full sequence as a step-by-step terminal animation. Click any amber RAG bar to open a **drill-down drawer** with the exact retrieved statute text and citation URLs.

### Live public stats
The landing page fetches `/api/stats` on load and displays live counters: average risk score and total clauses analysed across all reports. Backed by a Supabase aggregate view — no PII exposed.

### Share card
Every report has a **Share Report** button that opens a modal with a generated 1200×630 OpenGraph preview card (dark background, risk score, top flagged clauses) and a copy-link button. Links are valid for 90 days; no personal information is included in the preview.

### PDF Viewer with clause highlights
pdfjs-dist v5 renders the original PDF with colour-coded risk annotations that persist across page turns. Highlights use a normAndMap algorithm to survive OCR position drift.

### PIPEDA compliance
Upload consent gate, privacy policy, data retention notice, and DELETE erasure API. Benchmarked clause text is PII-stripped before storage. Signed URLs expire after 1 hour.

## Recording a demo video

Target: **60–90 seconds**, no audio needed, 1920×1080, exported as MP4 (H.264) + WebM for the README embed.

### Recommended tool

**ShareX** (Windows, free) — record a fixed region, outputs WebM/MP4 directly, no post-processing needed. Download at [getsharex.com](https://getsharex.com).

Alternative: `npx playwright test --video=on` captures WebM automatically during the `wow-features.spec.ts` run, but the viewport is fixed at 1280×720 and you can't control pacing.

### Before recording

1. Set browser window to 1920×1080 and zoom to 100%.
2. Open a private/incognito window at `https://leaseguard-sigma.vercel.app` — avoids "Sign in" prompts during recording.
3. Pre-open DevTools → Network tab, filter `XHR` — useful for showing the `/api/stats` call resolving live if you want a technical audience.
4. Have the demo lease URL ready in a second tab: `/report/ebf8bf97-563d-4b7d-859f-8ecf76905335`.

### Shot sequence (with target timestamps)

| # | Action | Target time | Notes |
|---|--------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Land on homepage — let stats bar count up | 0:00–0:08 | Pause briefly on the live counters: **6.7 avg · 444 clauses** |
| 2 | Drag or click to select `ontario_standard_lease.pdf` | 0:08–0:14 | Use `scripts/source-docs/ontario_standard_lease.pdf` |
| 3 | Tick consent checkbox, click Analyse | 0:14–0:16 | |
| 4 | Processing screen — step indicators animating | 0:16–0:30 | Let all 5 steps fill in; don't cut early |
| 5 | Report loads — Overview panel | 0:30–0:38 | Show risk gauge + stat cards (Red Flags, Negotiation Points, etc.) |
| 6 | Click **Red Flags** tab — expand one flag | 0:38–0:48 | Scroll to show the RTA citation below the clause text |
| 7 | Click **Negotiation Guide** → open Copilot → choose Assertive tone | 0:48–1:00 | Wait for Groq to stream the draft; don't cut mid-stream |
| 8 | Click **Agent Trace** → hit **▶ Watch the agent work** | 1:00–1:12 | Let ~10s of animation play; click a RAG bar mid-animation to show drill-down |
| 9 | Click **Share Report** → show OG card in modal | 1:12–1:18 | |
